    <p>Are you feeling as if you aren’t learning anything, not getting out of 
    your comfort zone enough, not reaching your goals you wanted to? Let me 
    tell you that you are. As someone who has their fair share of self doubts 
    and worries, I know for a fact that everyone is making progress one way or 
    another when they put their minds to it.<br>
    As long as you are trying through putting effort, even if you don’t see a
    drastic result right now doesn’t mean you won’t get there. It’s difficult 
    to shift your mindset into that type of way.<br>
    Here are a few steps you can take to help yourself understand every minimal
    growth means so much:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Being proactive</em></li>
        <li> <em>Have a positive mindset in believing in yourself and avoid others opinions</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further more about being proactive, it’s different from saying one thing and actually putting action into 
    something and doing it. To say something but never follow through means you 
    aren’t actually trying to do something about whatever your end goal or situation
    is. If you are being proactive whether it be changing something small in your daily
    life such as writing down what you are going to do for that day or even pushing 
    yourself to interact with one new person everyday.<br>
    Furthermore about having a positive mindset and avoiding others opinions, I know thats more difficult to say than actually believing,
    but it’s how you will succeed. If there are haters who believe you aren't making progress, you just 
    have to push through and understand that they will never know 100% how much you have 
    tried to put into your goal. No one will ever believe in you as much as yourself as you 
    are the most important person that needs to believe in yourself.</p>

    <h2>Learn How to Say No</h2>

    <p>Do you ever have a homework assignment, upcoming exams or you are just plain busy but 
    you aren’t unsure how to say no when someone asks you to do things?<br>
    I know I’ve been in that boat before so tune in to hear more on how to say no but in a 
    way that your friends will understand.<br>
    Here are the few steps you can take to ensure that you are able to say no to situations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>Be Firm with Your Answer</em></li>
        <li> <em>Be Sure to Thank Them, Be Gentle, and Explain the Situation</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore about being firm with your answer, To be firm but kind is quite 
    difficult to do for some as I know it’s easy to get frustrated when your friends 
    keep pestering you to go here and there when you already said no the first time. 
    You have to understand that it’s okay to say no to plans as you are the only person 
    that knows your limits on how much you can handle! You don’t want to ever get overwhelmed :).<br>
    Furthermore about being sure to thank them and explaining the situation, You have to be sure 
    to not be harsh or be rude to others when you are turning them down as it 
    might make them more upset or disappointed. It can get frustrating when you are trying 
    to tell them that you truly can’t and they keep asking you to, but it’s important to 
    explain the situation to them so they would be more understanding.</p>
